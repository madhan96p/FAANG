**Key Considerations for Investors:**

- **Volatility:** Low-priced stocks can be highly volatile. Assess fundamentals instead of just stock price.
- **Due Diligence:** Research financials, industry trends, and company performance.
- **Risk Management:** Diversify investments to spread risk.
- **Professional Advice:** Consult financial experts before investing.
- **Patience:** Multibaggers take years—avoid chasing quick returns.
